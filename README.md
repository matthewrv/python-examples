# Python by Example 🐍

A collection of small Python code snippets demonstrating important (and sometimes surprising) behaviors of the language and libraries I use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setting Up the Environment

- **NixOS users** (like me 😉): Simply run `nix-shell`, and you’re ready to explore Python’s intricacies.
- **Other systems**: Use `uv` to configure the project:

  ```bash
  uv sync
  ```

  After this, you should be good to go!

### Running Examples

Browse the `examples/` directory (organized by topic), read the commented code to understand what each script does, and run it with Python. For example:

```bash
python examples/threads/sql_alchemy_is_not_thread_safe.py
```

Happy coding! 🎉
